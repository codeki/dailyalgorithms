<h3>utility scripts for homo sapiens</h3>


These scripts are designed to perform monitoring, maintenance and basic optimization of the hardware and low-level systems underlying the latest releases of the version 2.x series of _Homo sapiens_<sup>1</sup>. Some of these scripts may be backward compatible with the version 1.x series (though likely irrelevant), and forward compatibility will require porting to a new framework. Inevitably, numerous "bugs" have been reported for _Homo sapiens_, often specific to a particular distribution or set of instances, affecting thousands to millions of units. However, the purpose of the scripts in this repository is to support basic operation; they are not patches for serious malfunctions.

As always, use at your own risk <sup>2</sup>. And feel free to fork, share<sup>3</sup>, augment and contribute new scripts.

1. _Homo sapiens_ Versioning (in brief): The version 1.x series was developed in Africa as a branch of the broader homonid project and successfully released approximately 200k years ago.  The requirements and typical usage for that time only demanded basic maintenance, e.g., feeding, fighting, sleeping, mating. The version 2.x series was developed in multiple centers of civilization between 10,000 and 3,000 BCE. New features included routines for more advanced I/O, complex hierarchical networks, and task specialization.  Version 3.x design is being lead by _Homo sapiens_ themselves on an accelerating development cycle, employing bioengineering and cybernetics. 

2. You take full responsibility for the outcome of running these scripts on yourself or others. We reserve the right to completely ignore complaints and to deny all liability. 

3. However, if you share these scripts (intentionally or unintentionally) with an intelligence (artificial or not) that goes on to sabotage _Homo sapiens_ operations (local or distributed) or otherwise mimic or outcompete _Homo sapiens_, well, that's on you! Consider yourself warned.
